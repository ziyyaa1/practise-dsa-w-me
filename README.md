# practise-dsa-w-me
I have made this repository for learning DS from scratch & uploaded it on github so that my friends can keep track of me and keep me motivated ;))
I will be uploading new files every day and each day will cover a new topic. I have took help from alot of different websites, books and youtube channels.
I have added comments to specify topic name, write notes and add tips.

1. Datatypes, cout and cin, operators and loops and all other basics of cpp.
2. Arrays.
3. Pointers.
4. Functions & other related topics.

7. All sorting techniques.
8. Recursion and backtracking.

Different practise questions will be added, might add few other topics too but that's it for now biye guys ;))
