# practise-dsa-w-me
I have made this repository for learning DS from scratch & uploaded it on github so that my friends can keep track of me and keep me motivated.;))
I will be uploading new files every day and each day will cover a new topic that is learned from alot of different websites, books and youtube channels.
Plus, I have write codes for practise and have solved a few questions related to a particular topic, comments are added to specify topic name, write notes add tips and for revision later on.
